Welcome!

To start development clone the repository and run

```
nvm use # requires nvm, node version manager, possibly optional. nvm use checks the .nvmrc file and uses that version of node
yarn # install dependencies, equivalent to npm install
yarn dev
```

I use vscode. To ensure proper linting and prettier, make sure you have eslint and prettier installed to vscode.
